# What problems does this library solve?

I have experienced this, maintaning express.js app is quite challenging when you are not the solo developer in your team. I've seen people following different patterns/approaches in the same express.js project. So we need something which sets some boundaries, which pushes us to write clean and maintainable code and something more than just boilerplate.

# Is there any alternate solution before this?

Yes, there is a great solution available in the community even before @tsxp and that is [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). For enterprise applications, Nest.js is a really good choice. However, the learning curve for Nest.js is steep, particularly if you come from Express.js or React.js.

I wanted something as simple as Express.js, so I started working on @tsxp.

# POV of the author?

This is a fun project. It is still in beta and still evolving. If you think you need something more stable, I'd recommend you go with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). Nest.js has great community support and experienced maintainers.
