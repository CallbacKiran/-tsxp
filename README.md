# Problem

I have experienced this maintaining express.js app is quite challenging when you are not a solo developer in your team. I've seen people following different patterns/approaches in the same express.js project. So, we need something which sets some boundaries, which pushes us to write clean and maintainable code, and something more than just boilerplate.

# Solution

There is a great solution available in the community even before @tsxp is [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). For enterprise applications, Nest.js is a really good choice.
But (there is a but, there is an innovation ðŸ˜ƒ) the learning curve for Nest.js is massive.

I wanted something as simpler as Express.js. So I started working on @tsxp.

# Suggestion

@tsxp is a fun project. It is still in beta and still evolving. If you think you need something more stable, I'll recommend you to go with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). Nest.js has great community support & experienced maintainers.

# Install

```sh
npx @tsxp/cli project-name
