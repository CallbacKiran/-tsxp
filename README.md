<br />

# The problem

I have seen a lots of backend project(specially expressjs/nodejs) they start very well but as they grow and grow maintaining them is quite cumbersome.

# The solution

There is a great solution available in market even before @tsxp is [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), for enterprise application Next.js is really good choice.
But (there is alway a but for new invention ðŸ˜ƒ) learning curve for Next.js is massive specially your background is from express.js/react.js.

so i started working on @tsxp

# suggestion

@tsxp is a fun project. it is meant for simple/small scale application, if you think your application will grow to the sky i'll recommend you to go with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). Nest.js has a great community support & experienced maintainer.

# Install

```sh
npx @tsxp/cli project-name
```
