# The problem

I have expirience this, maintaing express.js app it quite challenging when you are not solo developer in your team. I've seen people following defferent patters/approch in same express.js project. so we need something which set some boundries, which push us to write clean and maintainble code, somthing more than just boilerplate.

# The solution

There is a great solution available in market even before @tsxp is [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), for enterprise application Nest.js is really good choice.
But (there is a but, there is a innovation ðŸ˜ƒ) learning curve for Nest.js is massive specially your background is from express.js/react.js.

so i started working on @tsxp

# suggestion

@tsxp is a fun project. it is meant for simple/small scale application, if you think your application will grow to the sky i'll recommend you to go with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). Nest.js has a great community support & experienced maintainer.

```sh
npx @tsxp/cli project-name
